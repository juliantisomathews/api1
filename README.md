# api1

assignment 4 - api

What this includes:
- Has an api with routes that accept parameters
- Persistence that saves all of the data to a .JSON file
- An interface that lives on the client side to interact with the API

How to run the application:
- open the api in your preferred code editor
- run the server.js file in your terminal using: node server.js

How I built my HTML page:
- first started on the server side and built various end points using the get() function.
- struggled a bit using the fetch() function on the client side so instead leveraged the p5 library to build my interface

Inspiration:
- came mostly from Dan Shiffman's api series, which was incredibly helpful - really helped my holistic understanding of server side web development works.
